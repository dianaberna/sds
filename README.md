# SDS - Safe Domotic Shop

**⚠️ This project is not maintained anymore**

Project realized as a thesis for the maturity of the high school ITIS "G. & M. Montani" Fermo address Informatica Abacus, school year 2012/2013.

"SDS - Safe Domotic Shop" aims to demonstrate how computer knowledge can merge with electronic knowledge, in very important aspects of people's daily life, both from the point of view of quality of life, savings, as well as safety .
This project consists in the creation of an electronic device that allows you to manage your shop wherever you are, in fact to enjoy all this you just need to use any device connected to the Internet.

Obviously, in addition to the electronic equipment, a website has also been developed that allows the control of all the sensors available in the store and the management of the security video. The ability to manage a shop or a house remotely is not science fiction, it is already implemented, albeit at high costs.

In this case, for the implementation it was decided to use a programmable electronic board called Arduino and the Raspberry PI mini computer which is part of the Embedded Single Board Computers (SBC), i.e. complete computers mounted on a single board, with microprocessor, memory, input / output (I / O) and other features required of a functional computer.
